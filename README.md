# MOVED #

The development of this project has moved here: [https://github.com/videlalvaro/php-amqplib](https://github.com/videlalvaro/php-amqplib).

# NOTE #

This library is a fork of the [php-amqplib](http://code.google.com/p/php-amqplib/) library.

We modified that library in order to work with PHP 5.3 Strict.

Also we improved the debug method to increase performance.

We use it daily in prod for sending/consuming 600K + messages per day.

Below is the original README file content. Credits goes to the original authors.

## Usage ##

Start your RabbitMQ server, then get the source:

		$ git clone git://github.com/tnc/php-amqplib.git

Open two Terminals and on the first one execute the following commands to start the consumer:

		$ cd php-amqplib/demo
		$ php amqp_consumer.php

Then on the other Terminal do:

		$ cd php-amqplib/demo
		$ php amqp_publisher.php some text to publish

You should see the message arriving to the process on the other Terminal

Then to stop the consumer, send to it the `quit` message:

		$ php amqp_publisher.php quit

# Debugging #

If you want to know what's going on at a protocol level then add the following constant to your code:

		<?php
		define('AMQP_DEBUG', true);

		... more code

		?>
